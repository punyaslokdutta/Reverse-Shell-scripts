# Reverse-Shell-scripts
A reverse shell is a shell session established on a connection that is initiated from a remote machine, not from the local host. Attackers who successfully exploit a remote command execution vulnerability can use a reverse shell to obtain an interactive shell session on the target machine and continue their execution.
